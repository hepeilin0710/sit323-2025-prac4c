# üßÆ Calculator Microservice ‚Äì Credit Task Submission

This project is a Node.js-based calculator microservice built using Express.  
It is developed as a submission for **Part I ‚Äì Credit Task**, with the selection of:

---

## ‚úÖ Option A: Additional Arithmetic Operations

This microservice expands basic calculator functionality by including:

- **Exponentiation** (`/power`)
- **Modulo** (`/modulo`)
- **Square Root** (`/sqrt`)

It also includes essential arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Proper input validation and error handling are included to ensure reliability and robustness.
